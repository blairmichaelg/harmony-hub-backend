## Consistencies Required

To maintain consistency across the project, adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Code Style**: Follow the rules defined in `.prettierrc.json` and `eslint.config.mjs`.
- **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files to manage environment-specific configurations.
- **Error Handling**: Use the `logErrorWithStack` function from [`src/utils/logging.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FProjects%2Fharmony-hub-backend%2Fsrc%2Futils%2Flogging.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22logErrorWithStack%22%5D 'c:\\Users\Projects\harmony-hub-backend\src\utils\logging.ts') for logging errors.
- **Configuration Management**: Follow the guidelines in [`ConfigManagementPlan.md`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FProjects%2Fharmony-hub-backend%2Fsrc%2Fconfig%2FConfigManagementPlan.md%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22ConfigManagementPlan.md%22%5D 'c:\\Users\Projects\harmony-hub-backend\src\config\ConfigManagementPlan.md').

## Purpose and Goals

The primary goal of the HarmonyHub backend is to provide a reliable and efficient service layer that supports the platform's unique features. This includes:

- **Audio Processing**: Efficiently handle audio processing tasks such as transcription, generation, and smart track separation.
